        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>My name is Rodrigo Perez, I never really knew how to define myself because it doesn't really make sense to state who you are based on the job you have which says nothing about you, so I'm going to try my best.<br>
        I'm an amateur CSGO player who couldn't make it into the Pumas rugby team, so I decided to get absolutley jacked and become a superhuman machine that can lift 500lb deadlifts to impress my bros, but on the inside I'm still hurt that I couldn't achive my dream of becoming a professional rugby player. Nevertheless I look better than 99% of planet earth, that should be enough to be happy right? Right? Sorry, I'm just wiping my tears. I've digressed way to hard, I belive I have ADHD. To summarize my values in life are the following:<br>
        -Always do the fucking best in whatever you're doing (What you do in one area of your life taints all of your other endeavors)<br>
        -Treat people with respect because we're all human beings on this planet trying to make the best of our time (even if you didn't know it)<br>
        -Live for you (this is pretty self explanatory)<br>
        -PD: I'm going to explain the above because it's not that self explanatory. Live life on your own terms (however, try not to go to jail in the process, that's definitely not ideal) because at the end of the day you can only affect the people around you insomuch as your are happy and enjoying your own life<br>
        -Be honest: Human 101 here, it's the minimun requirement to live in society, just be honest it's not that harde mate and rule number 1 applies here.<br>
        Hope you're still there buddy, I'm just having some fun spilling my thoughts into this beautiful page. If you resonate with myself you should buy my $99.99 course on how to be an absolute sickcunt and seize every second of your life. Just kidding, it's free. But if you wanna be in great shape you could hire my as a Coach :)</p>
